# RideRevo  
### A Bike Riding and Booking Application for Females only.

> Riderevo is a mobile application developed in Flutter. It is a user-friendly and secure platform designed to 
empower women by providing them with a convenient and safe means of booking 
bike rides. The application aims to promote gender equality and encourage more 
women to embrace biking as a mode of transportation. Through seamless ride 
booking, the application seeks to address the specific transportation needs and 
safety concerns faced by women. The application offers a user-friendly interface that 
allows women to easily navigate through various features, and select their desired 
pickup and drop-off locations, ensuring a hassle-free experience for users.



## Problem Statement and Objectives
### Safety and Security
Women face safety concerns and lack of secure transportation options, which hinders their mobility and confidence in commuting.
### Gender Equality
The existing transportation infrastructure often fails to consider the specific needs of female commuters, resulting in a lack of gender-sensitive facilities.
### Convenience and Efficiency
Traditional transportation systems may not always offer convenient and efficient options for female commuters.
### Promote Empowerment and Independence
The application aims to empower female riders by giving them the freedom to travel independently and confidently.
